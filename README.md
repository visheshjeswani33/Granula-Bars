# Granula Bars

# About:
Granola is a breakfast food and snack food consisting of rolled oats, nuts, honey or other sweeteners such as 
brown sugar, and sometimes puffed rice, that is usually baked until it is crisp, toasted and golden brown. It also
serves as a topping for various pastries, desserts or ice cream.

# INGREDIENTS:

2 1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats
1/2 cup nuts, roughly chopped
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup total extra mix-ins (about 1/4 cup of 3 different ingredients such as dried fruits, coconut, chocolate chips,
cranberries,etc.)

# INSTRUCTIONS:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with parchment or foil and lightly spray with 
cooking spray.

Place the oats and nuts on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes until lightly toasted. Place the nuts
 and oats in a large bowl.

While the oats are toasting, add the honey, butter, and brown sugar to a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until
 the butter melts and the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally.

When butter mixture is ready, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla and salt. Pour this mixture over the oats
 and nuts mixture and stir to combine. Add any extra ingredients (except for chocolate) and stir to combine. 

Make sure none of the oats are dry.
If you are adding chocolate, wait about 15 minutes for the mixture to cool a bit before adding the chocolate and
 then stirring to combine.
Place all of the oat mixture in the prepared pan. Use a rubber spatula or the bottom of a greased measuring cup to press 
the mixture into the pan. Chill the granola bars for at least 2 hours. 

Lift the bars from the pan using the edges of the foil or parchment and place them on a cutting board. 
Cut into desired shape/sizes and serve.

# Tips and Tricks for making this homemade granola bar recipe:

1] You can use 1/3 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar in this recipe if you like a stronger honey flavor. 
   The granola bars will be slightly more sticky this way. My kids did not like this ratio, though I 
   thought it was great. The honey flavor was too strong for them.

2] You can replace the brown sugar with honey and gently boil the mixture for about a minutes for these
   bars (stirring lots, honey burns quickly). The honey flavor was very strong but the bars held together. 
   I didn’t really like the bars like this (honey flavor but when I used less they didn’t stick together).

3] You can make the recipe as written and gently boil the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes and the bars will have 
   a little more crunch to them and will be less soft/sticky.

4] I’m 90% sure you could replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar though haven’t tried it yet.

5] I liked to press my bars down a second time after they chilled for the 2 hours. This really helped them 
   to hold together well.

6] These store super well in the fridge or freezer.

7] You don’t actually have to put the oats/nuts in the bowl. If the pan that you toasted them on is large 
   enough you can just pour the hot honey mixture over the top and carefully stir everything together right 
   on the pan. It’s a little trickier, but I’d rather take a little more time to stir than wash an extra bowl.

8] I feel like these are good after the 2 hour rest but I feel like they are really good after you let them sit
  overnight (this could be at room temperature if you are short on fridge space…). It gives everything time to 
  blend and the texture improves.

9] Putting coconut oil in place of the butter will turn out great though they not hold together pretty good.
